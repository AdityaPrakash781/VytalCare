The flu (influenza) is a contagious viral infection affecting the respiratory system. 
Symptoms begin suddenly and include fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, body aches, headaches, and fatigue. 
The virus spreads through droplets and contaminated surfaces. 
Most people recover in about a week, but high-risk groups (elderly, young children, pregnant people, chronic disease patients) may develop complications like pneumonia. 
Treatment includes antivirals (best within 48 hours), rest, fluids, and fever reducers. 
The annual flu vaccine is the most effective prevention method.
